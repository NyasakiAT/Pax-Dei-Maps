Welcome to Pax Dei Maps! This is a basic website I put together to start tracking resources in Pax Dei. 
Please do not consider this a full/complete project, it's really a proof-of-concept for ideas I had while testing. 

I'm by no means a web developer, and barely a programmer. Most of my dev time is spent on Discord-based Bot projects, so this pushed me out of my comfort zone.

## Site Functionality
This site primarily functions as a resource tracker and external map for Pax Dei.
- Users can add temporary markers via left-click, and remove them with ctrl+left-click.
- Data point additions and removals are handled via Discord Bot commands or manual entries to the JSON files.
- Navigate the map by click-dragging, and zoom in/out via mouse wheel.
- There is no login/account creation at this time, and any temporary data points added are NOT saved.


## Bot Functionality
I designed this site to work in conjunction with a Discord bot that accepts user inputs and adds data points to the JSON files (not included in this code).
The bot accepts single and bulk resource additions and removals via commands, and updates the various JSON files accordingly.

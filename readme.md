Welcome to Pax Dei Maps! This is a basic website I put together to start tracking resources in Pax Dei. 
Please do not consider this a full/complete project, it's really a proof-of-concept for ideas I had while testing. 

I'm by no means a web developer, and barely a programmer. Most of my dev time is spent on Discord-based Bot projects, so this pushed me out of my comfort zone.

## Site Functionality
- This site primarily functions as a resource tracker, and also allows users to add temporary markers via left-click.
- Temporary markers can be removed via ctrl+left-click.


## Bot Functionality
I designed this site to coincide with the use of a Discord bot that accepts user inputs and adds data points to the JSON files (not included in this code).
The bot accepts single and bulk resource additions and removals via commands, and updates the various JSON files accordingly.
